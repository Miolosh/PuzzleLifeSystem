# PuzzleLifeSystem
A basic life system for a mobile puzzle game made in Unity. The following functionalities are included: 

* Base lifes regenerating over time
* Lifes that can be used as bought lifes. These lifes are only lost if all base lifes are lost.
* Unlimited lifes which will give the player unlimited tries on the puzzle/game during the period given. 

For all three type of lifes, counters are provided. Those have to be linked to the life controller. Currently, the counters will only check on the first frame if they have to be visible. The counters are made with the assumption that lifes are bought in another scene. 

The script is meant for my own future games to act as a basic life system.
